## Abstract
The Dynamic Operation Of Developmentally-Learned Encoded Sequences (DOODLES) project aims to revolutionize AI systems by addressing the challenges of learning and recalling behavior sequences. By spatially encoding behavior sequences, DOODLES seeks to create an efficient framework for retaining and expanding learned behaviors, primarily in the form of drawings. The project's core objectives include designing an innovative model for behavior sequence encoding and ensuring it can preserve previously-learned behaviors. Simultaneously, DOODLES strives to provide the capacity for the model to adapt and acquire new behaviors as it scales, marking a significant advancement in AI's ability to mimic, remember, and evolve human-like behaviors.
