## Project Concerns Essay
The main constraints with my project are economic. As is the case with most projects within the 
field of Artificial Intelligence, one of the major concerns with any developed model is the cost of training 
the model. As a model gets more complex and has more parameters to train, training that model will be 
more expensive in terms of time and processing power. Because I am limited to either my own personal 
CPU or a Google Colaboratory GPU with limited usage rates, I am forced to limit the model I produce to 
not being extremely huge or expensive.

I am also relatively constrained with this project in terms of security. Because I’m attempting to 
develop a model that is unique to my own work and creation, I need to ensure I keep my codebase and 
files secure and safe. If others accessed my codebase, my work could be stolen. In order to preserve my 
work and ensure that I am able to claim it as my own, it’s best to protect the security of my project.
A potential side issue with my project is the high-level ethical concerns about artificial 
intelligence as a field in general. While my project is definitely not making strides towards developing the 
next Skynet, contributing to a field that is seen as ethically concerning in some spaces should not be 
taken lightly.
