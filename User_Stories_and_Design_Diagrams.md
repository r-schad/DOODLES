## Project Title
DOODLES (Drawing Operation Of Developmentally-Learned Encoded Sequences)
## Goal Statement
Develop a neural model to spatially encode sequences of behaviors in the form 
of drawing doodles.

# Part 1: User Stories
1. As a robotics researcher, I want to be able to create a robot that can doodle, following my 
desired behaviors, so that I can produce a robot capable of doodling as I desire.
2. As an art professor, I want to use an AI system to doodle, so that my students can be tasked with 
determining which doodles are AI generated vs human generated.
3. As an Intelligent Systems Researcher, I want to be able to ensure that my system is able to recall 
specific sequences of behaviors given a specific input, so that my system can accomplish 
complex actions.
4. As an Intelligent Systems Researcher, I want to be able to encode sequences of behavior 
spatially, so that my model is much more efficient and has less parameters to learn.
5. As a Intelligent Systems Researcher, I want to discover an approach to spatially encoding 
behavior sequences via a unique neural model so that I can build a model suited to my needs 
that can achieve complex behaviors

# Part 2: Design Diagrams
Diagram Conventions:
Circles/Rectangles represent layers and structures within the neural model. Arrows represent signals 
passing from one layer within the model to another.
