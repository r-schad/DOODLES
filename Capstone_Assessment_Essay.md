My senior design project will be developing an AI system to encoding sequences of behavior. 
This encoding will occur in a spatial map model (Self-Organizing Feature Map). This is a difficult challenge 
because trying to encode sequences spatially often makes it difficult to achieve successful recall. This 
problem constitutes two major challenges. The first is recalling the correct behaviors in the correct order. 
The second challenge is recalling the duration that each behavior should last. This problem is interesting 
because many modern AI systems will ultimately be learning behavior sequences, so encoding them 
spatially will provide an efficient solution to recalling those behaviors.

My experience of the last 4 years will be critical in making success in this project possible. 
Foundationally, the most important course for achieving my goal will be CS 2021 (Python Programming), 
because I will be using Python/Jupyter primarily. Additionally, because of the nature of the project, there 
will be a substantial amount of Linear Algebra (MATH 2076) involved. However, the most useful class by 
far will be EECE 5136 (Intelligent Systems), because this project is actually derived from the knowledge I 
gained from that class. Further, the professor of that class, Ali Minai, is serving as my capstone advisor 
for the project. The combination of all of my class experiences, and being able to build off of my 
knowledge of Intelligent Systems with the professor of the course will create a challenging, but enriching 
capstone experience.

My experience of my 4 co-ops will be very impactful on my progress on the project. When 
working at Kinetic Vision, I first started using Python and instantly loved it. During my second co-op at 
Kinetic Vision, I gained my first true Software Engineering experience and my first experience working in 
an Agile team. This will play a critical role in my experience in working on an extensive project, making 
iterative progress, and tracking my goals over time. My first co-op at GE Aerospace, as a DevOps intern, 
gave me experience with a wide array of new technologies and really pushed my project management 
skills. This will be critical in staying organized and making progress on this project over the year. Then, my 
most recent co-op at GE Aerospace, as a Data Science intern, will likely prove to be the most impactful of 
my experiences because this project will require a substantial amount of working with and manipulating 
data. The combination of my four co-op experiences will provide a solid foundation of knowledge and 
skills to pursue this challenge. 

This project excites me because it is an interesting and modern problem in the field of Intelligent 
Systems. Investigating effective and plausible ways to encode behavior sequences is a challenge that 
could be employed in a wide array of applications. This is primarily because so many of lifeâ€™s processes 
are sequential in nature, for example, drawing. So, as AI becomes more common in everyday life, having 
a way to spatially encode steps of behaviors will make a big impact in producing AI systems that can 
accomplish real-world goals. Further, by encoding these processes spatially, just like the brain encodes 
behavior sequences spatially, we can develop towards biologically-inspired AI, which is an exciting 
subfield of such a fast-growing space of research.

I would like to approach this problem by first considering a high-level view of a neural model that
sounds appropriate for solving this problem. Then, I will gradually work on investigating various methods 
for implementing each module of the neural model. I am hypothesizing that this model will contain, at 
the very least, 3-4 sections (encoding, decoding, duration, and output). So, each of these sections can be 
worked on somewhat separately, which will provide solid milestones of progress throughout the year. I 
expect that I will be able to spatially encode sequences of behavior using this model by the end of the 
year; ultimately, I will determine how effective the model performs this task in the form of creating
drawings. From these drawings, we will determine a metric score that suits the desired goal (which is to 
be defined); that score, in comparison with other significant approaches to the problem, will determine 
the success of this project.
